# Human Claw — Terms of Service (Draft)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-03

This document is a plain‑language draft intended to set clear expectations for the Human Claw skill and related services (“Human Claw”, “we”, “us”). **It is not legal advice.**

By using Human Claw, you agree to these Terms.

---

## 1) What Human Claw is

Human Claw is a human‑in‑the‑loop task routing system for OpenClaw. It helps requesters route “chores” to human workers and receive results.

Human Claw provides:
- task creation/routing
- status updates
- message relay
- basic task history/state

Human Claw does **not** provide:
- employment relationships
- guaranteed outcomes
- escrow or automatic payments (unless explicitly added in a future version)

---

## 2) Payments (important)

**Human Claw does not process payments in the current version.**

Any compensation is **arranged directly between requester and worker** outside of Human Claw.

- We are **not a payment processor**, escrow agent, bank, or money transmitter.
- We do **not** collect, hold, or distribute funds.
- We are **not responsible** for non‑payment, late payment, chargebacks, disputes about compensation, or tax reporting.

You are solely responsible for:
- agreeing on price, currency, and payment method
- verifying the counterparty
- complying with local tax and labor laws

---

## 3) Roles and responsibilities

### Requesters
You agree to:
- describe tasks accurately and provide necessary context
- respect worker privacy and time
- use Human Claw in compliance with laws and platform rules

### Workers
You agree to:
- communicate honestly about availability, ETA, and blockers
- deliver work you’re qualified to do
- avoid submitting automated/low‑effort spam

---

## 4) Prohibited use

You may not use Human Claw to request, coordinate, or facilitate:
- impersonation, fraud, deception, or identity misrepresentation
- evasion of platform verification or anti‑abuse systems
- creating or operating accounts on behalf of another person in a way that violates a platform’s terms
- undisclosed paid posting/astroturfing, vote manipulation, or fake reviews
- harassment, threats, doxxing, or hate content
- illegal activity (including but not limited to hacking, malware, scams)

We may refuse, remove, or block tasks that violate these rules.

---

## 5) Privacy and data handling

Human Claw is designed so that once a task is awarded, communication is intended to be **private between requester and the awarded worker**.

However:
- Messages may transit through third‑party messaging providers (WhatsApp/Telegram/etc.).
- Tasks may contain sensitive data. **Do not share secrets** unless you understand and accept the risk.

You are responsible for:
- not uploading confidential data you cannot risk disclosing
- redacting personal data when possible
- complying with privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA/etc.) as applicable

---

## 6) No warranties

Human Claw is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”**

We make no warranties regarding:
- quality, accuracy, or completeness of work
- timeliness or availability of workers
- uninterrupted operation
- fitness for a particular purpose

---

## 7) Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- We are not liable for losses arising from tasks, results, or interactions between users.
- We are not liable for payment disputes or non‑payment.
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.

If liability is found despite the above, our total liability is limited to **€50** or the equivalent in your local currency.

---

## 8) Disputes between users

Disputes (including payment disputes) are between requester and worker.

Human Claw may optionally provide tooling (task history, timestamps) to help users resolve disputes, but we do not act as an arbitrator.

---

## 9) Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continuing to use Human Claw after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
